- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Yordan Hinov, the curious guy.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things, generally in technology for business, especially extras that can be used to extend AssignmentProâ„¢ (visually, functionally or process wise). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, JS, some specific CSS styling.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - best option: LinkedIn. See you there!
